Interface to FFTW, version 3
============================

Perquisites
-----------

The FFTW, version 3, with its development files (``fftw3.h``) must be
installed on your system.  For example, on Debian or Ubuntu, you need
to install the package ``libfftw3-dev`` (see the package
[conf-fftw3](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/conf-fftw3/) for other
distributions — click the “Edit” link).


Compilation
-----------

The easier way to install this library is by using [opam][]:

    opam install fftw3

If you cloned this repository, you can use [Dune][dune] to
compile it:

    dune build @install

If your fftw3 header files or libraries are not where you C compiler
expects to find them and `pkg-config` does not return the right
location either, you need to tell the [discover
script](config/discover.ml) where to find them by setting the
environment variable `FFTW3_CFLAGS`:

    FFTW3_CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib"

Of course, replace ``/opt/local/include`` (resp. ``/opt/local/lib``) by the
actual paths of your header files (resp. library).

Usage
-----

Fftw3 contains two submodules differing only by precision ``Fftw3.D`` for
double precision and ``Fftw3.S`` for single precision.  Note that the
functions of the single precision module will raise ``Failure`` if the
corresponding FFTW3 library was not discovered by the configure
script.  See the [mli file](src/fftw3.mli) for more details
or consult the documentation
[online](https://chris00.github.io/fftw-ocaml/doc/fftw3/Fftw3/).


Examples
--------

Some examples need additional libraries:
- [Lacaml](http://mmottl.github.io/lacaml/)
- [Archimedes](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/archimedes/)

If these are not detected by the configure script, the corresponding
examples will not be compiled or will have less features.


Bugs
----

To report bugs, use the Github
[issues page](https://github.com/Chris00/fftw-ocaml/issues).


Development
-----------

If you want to participate to the development of Fftw3, make a
fork of the [project](https://github.com/Chris00/fftw-ocaml) and
submit a pull request.


Licence
-------
