		     Interface to FFTW, version 3

------------------------------------------------------------------------

PERQUISITES

The FFTW, version 3, with its development files (fftw3.h) must be
installed on your platform.


COMPILATION

  ./bootstrap (optional, requires autoconf)
  ./configure
  make

If your fftw3 header files or libraries are not where you C compiler
expects to find them, you need to tell configure by using the
following syntax:

  CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib" ./configure

Of course, replace /opt/local/include (resp. /opt/local/lib) by the
actual paths of your header files (resp. library).


USAGE

Fftw3 contains two submodules differing only by precision Fftw3.D for
double precision and Fftw3.S for single precision.  Note that the
single precision module will only exist if the corresponding FFTW3
library was discovered by the configure script.  See the mli file for
more details.


BUGS

To report bugs, send an email to <chris_77@users.sourceforge.net>.


DEVELOPMENT

If you want to participate to the development of Fftw3, make a
checkout from thr SVN repository on sourceforge
(https://ocaml-fftw.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ocaml-fftw/trunk).
Personally, I use bzr (http://bazaar-vcs.org/) for development
(branching from the SVN repository above) so you just need to publish
your branch somewhere on the web and tell me so I can track it.


LICENCE

FFtw3 is released under the LGPL with the special axception of the
standard library.  See the file LICENSE for more details.

Although not required, it will be appreciated if your product mentions
it uses these bindings.
