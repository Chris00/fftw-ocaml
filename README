		     Interface to FFTW, version 3

------------------------------------------------------------------------

PERQUISITES

The FFTW, version 3, with its development files (fftw3.h) must be
installed on your platform.


COMPILATION

  ocamlbuild fftw3.cma fftw3.cmxa

  (or "make" which will be available until ocamlbuild becomes common)


USAGE

Fftw3 contains two submodules differing only by precision Fftw3.D for
double precision and Fftw3.S for single precision.  See the mli file
for more details.


BUGS

To report bugs, send an email to <chris_77@users.sourceforge.net>.


DEVELOPMENT

If you want to participate to the development of Fftw3, make a
checkout from thr SVN repository on sourceforge
(https://ocaml-fftw.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ocaml-fftw/trunk).
Personally, I use bzr (http://bazaar-vcs.org/) for development
(branching from the SVN repository above) so you just need to publish
your branch somewhere on the web and tell me so I can track it.


LICENCE

FFtw3 is released under the LGPL with the special axception of the
standard library.  See the file LICENSE for more details.

Although not required, it will be appreciated if your product mentions
it uses these bindings.
