(** Cross-correlation function estimates.  This example is based on
    the Matlab® xcorr.m function and tries to respect its behavior.

    [xcorr a b], where [a] and [b] are two vectors, returns
    cross-correlation sequence of length [2*m - 1] where [m = max
    (dim a) (dim b)].  If [a == b], then the result is the
    auto-correlation sequence.  The zeroth lag of the output
    correlation is in the middle of the sequence, at element
    [maxlag+1] ([= m] by default).

    @raise Invalid_argument if [a] and [b] are of different length.

    [xcorr] produces an estimate of the correlation between two random
    (jointly stationary) sequences:
    {v
    C(m) = E[A(n+m)*conj(B(n))] = E[A(n)*conj(B(n-m))]
    v}
    It is also the deterministic correlation between two deterministic
    signals.

    @param maxlag computes the (auto/cross) correlation over the range
    of lags: [-maxlag] to [maxlag], i.e., the vector returned by
    [xcorr a b] will be of length [2 * maxlag + 1] lags.  If missing,
    default is [maxlag = m-1].

    @param scale normalizes the correlation according to the value
    - [Biased]: scales the raw cross-correlation by 1/M.
    - [Unbiased]: scales the raw correlation by 1/(M-abs(lags)).
    - [Coeff]: normalizes the sequence so that the auto-correlations
    at zero lag are identically 1.0.

    The default is [?scale=None], i.e. no scaling.
